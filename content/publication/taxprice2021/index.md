abstract: Using a large administrative dataset from Canada we estimate that the tax price elasticity of charitable donations is -1. When we allow for heterogeneity of this parameter across the income distribution, we observe an inverse U-shaped pattern in the elasticity that ranges from -1.4 to -0.18. Our elasticity point estimates result more from donors adjusting the amount donated than the decision to donate or not.
